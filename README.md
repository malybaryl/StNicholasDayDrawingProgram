# St. Nicholas Day Drawing Program

## Description

The St. Nicholas Day Drawing Program is a simple C++ program designed to help you organize the tradition of drawing names for gift exchanges on St. Nicholas Day (or any similar occasion). This program ensures that each participant receives a random assignment of whom they should give a gift to, creating an element of surprise and fun.

## How It Works

1. Start the program.

2. Enter the names of all participants. You can keep adding names until everyone is included.

3. Press a key to start the drawing process.

4. The program will randomly select a participant and display their name on the screen.

5. The selected person should approach the computer and press any key to reveal the name of the person they will be giving a gift to.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all participants have received the name of the person they should give a gift to. The order in which participants approach the computer and the gift assignments are all randomized for maximum excitement.

7. Once all assignments have been made, the program will end.

8. The participants can then proceed to buy or make gifts for the assigned individuals, keeping their selections a secret until the gift exchange event.

## Features

- Easy input of participant names.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.

2. Build program by cmake.

   Open your console in program folder and type (example for Ubuntu):
